## Synopsis

Sudoku's objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so
that each column, each row, and each of the
nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also
called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or
"subsquares") contains all of the digits from 1
to 9.

So we see each grid as a vertex, and all the vertice in the same column, same row, or same box are adjacent.
Then use k-coloring algorithm to solve sudoku.


## Motivation

An application to graph coloring
